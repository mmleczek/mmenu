# mmenu
FiveM resource, created for a easy way of creating context menus in game.
Mmenu was based on [esx_menu_default](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_menu_default).
It **does not require** to install ESX for usage. 

I took some time optimising whole resource.
Idling 0.0 ms, operating around 0.04ms *(running on Ryzen 3800x at 4.2 gHz)*
